# Dijkstra-s-Alg-Optimization-Using-Pairing-Heap
Language: C++
IDE: Visual Studio
Time Spent: 12h
Reason: CSC 2200 Honors Project

An optimization of Dijkstra's Algorithm using Michael Fredman and Robert Tarjan's Pairing heap, modified using an extra pointer to track parent relationships. This project also runs the same algorithm using a standard priority queue, while their execution times are similar using the provided graphs, the difference in complexity becomes apparent at higher values of N.
